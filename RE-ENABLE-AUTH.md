# Re-Enable Authentication After Tournament Weekend

## Quick Instructions

To re-enable authentication after the tournament weekend, simply:

1. **Uncomment the authentication code** in these files:
   - `src/pages/index.js`
   - `src/pages/results.js` 
   - `src/pages/teams.js`
   - `src/pages/schedule.js`

2. **Remove the temporary lines** that set `setAuthenticated(true)`

3. **Uncomment the authentication checks** in data fetching functions

## What Was Changed

### Authentication Disabled:
- ✅ **Login form hidden** - Users can access all pages directly
- ✅ **Data loading enabled** - All Firebase data loads without authentication
- ✅ **Navigation visible** - Full navigation menu available to everyone

### Files Modified:

### To Re-Enable:
1. Find all `// TEMPORARILY DISABLED AUTHENTICATION FOR TOURNAMENT WEEKEND` comments
2. Uncomment the original authentication code
3. Remove the `setAuthenticated(true)` lines
4. Uncomment the `if (authenticated)` checks
